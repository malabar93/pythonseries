This Project has been initialized by two guys on google Project. (https://code.google.com/p/betapy/)

I just retake the architecture of the file and update the all project to
support the version 2.2 of the Betaseries API.

I will do this step by step and I do not guarantee the functionment of all methods.

Use this roject at your own risks. I do not guarantee the safety of this ! If you found some bugs, please report them ! if you have suggestion, submit them !

My goal is to have a simple API to abstract just a level to the BetaSeries API. If you have more high-level ideas, submit them anyway
